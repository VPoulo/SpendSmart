<p>Welcome to <strong>SpendSmart</strong> — the world's most secure expense tracker that doesn't actually remember
    anything.</p>

<h2>🧠 What We Store</h2>
<p>Absolutely nothing. Your data lives in memory only — like a goldfish. When you close the app or restart it,
    <em>poof</em>, it’s gone. That’s because we use an in-memory database. No hard drives, no cloud servers, just good
    old RAM.
</p>

<h2>🔐 Is My Data Safe?</h2>
<p>As safe as it can be when it disappears every time you hit refresh. Nobody — not even you — can access your data
    after a restart. So yes, extremely secure by design.</p>

<h2>👁️ Who Can See My Data?</h2>
<p>Only you, while the app is running. We don’t collect, track, sell, or even glance at your data. We're too busy
    forgetting it.</p>

<h2>📉 Why Does This App Exist?</h2>
<p>This app exists purely to help the developer (me) learn how to build ASP.NET Core apps with Entity Framework. That’s
    it. No hidden agendas, no creepy tracking, no cookie banners.</p>

<h2>🍪 Cookies?</h2>
<p>Zero. Unless you brought your own.</p>
